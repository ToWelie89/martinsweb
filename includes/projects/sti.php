							This is a website and a community that I founded together with a friend in 2010, a third friend also joined the project later on.
							It was a community targeted for people who played the RTS-game Starcraft 2. The idea came up when we discussed organizing a
							tournament for other likeminded people. The idea evolved into a community where players could registrate, sign up for tournaments,
							take part in discussions and other activities. The tournaments was then in turn organized by the three of us. We successfully hosted
							two major tournaments with 16 and 32 participating players as well as other minor events. After that we stopped working on the site
							due to lack of interest and time.

							I coded pretty much the entire site myself, from frontend to backend. I was new to php and MySQL so to me it was a good project to start
							learning these technologies. I didn't follow any tutorials and didn't use any premade components as I wanted to do everything from
							scratch, like our message forum, PM system, mail forms, login, instant chat, tournament signup functionality, time scheduling service etc.

							As I stopped managing the site it became pretty dead and also got attacked by various bots that flooded my database with junk data. This
							was due to insufficient security measures that I hadn't bothered to fix after I discovered them as I had already stopped working on the
							site. Because of this my account at hosting24 where I hosted the site got suspended which unfortunately meant I could not recover my
							database of members, forum messages, PM's, matches etc. I could however retrieve the source code which I now host myself on my own server
							but since the database structure is missing a lot of MySQL calls will fail and some pages are therefore not working properly.
