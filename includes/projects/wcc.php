					This is a web application I created just before the World Cup in 2014. I wanted a way to simulate different outcomes in the
					tournament to see how it could all turn out. The simulators I found while googling only took into account if a match ends in a win, draw
					or loss. None of them took into account the goal difference which can play a major difference in the group stage, so therefore I created
					this application. In my app you can enter an exact result for each match to simulate different outcomes.
					<br><br>
					After the user has filled out a result for every single match the user is given a code, which is basically all the results compressed,
					that can then be shared with others, for instance via Facebook, to show how they think the tournament would end up. All the logic is
					written in Javascript and I use the libraries jQuery and requirejs. If I ever make a new version of this web app I will use Angular as it
					would greatly simplify the code. Feel free to try it out below or look at the soruce code.
