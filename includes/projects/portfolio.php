					This is the very site you're on right now, my personal website and portfolio. I began working on a 
					first portfolio that can still be found on <a href="http://www.martins-web.com" target="_blank">martins-web.com</a> 
					but I only got a design down and then scrapped the project. I wasn't satisfied with some aspects of the design and 
					I also wanted to host the site myself whereas this one is hosted via one.com. In august 2014 I began working on 
					this new portfolio.
					<br><br>
					This site uses modern webdesign technologies. jQuery is used a lot but also other frameworks such as Angular 
					and requirejs for handling MV*-patterns on the clientside, for structuring scripts and handling module loading. 
					I also work with less to easier structure CSS stylings. The complete source code is versioned via Github which 
					you can view below by clicking the Code-button. I develop on my local machine using WAMP-server and whenever 
					a certain part feels complete I push it to Github and then pull it from the server for easy and fast deployment.
					<br><br>
					The server itself is a Raspberry Pi that I manage myself. It runs Raspbian OS, NodeJS, Apache, php, SSH-client 
					and other useful tools for making it into a fully capable webserver. It is plugged into my router which is 
					configured to forward HTTP and SSH ports to the Raspberry Pi. I also have cronjobs in place to handle backup 
					of data and updating the DynDNS pointer for my domain operator.
