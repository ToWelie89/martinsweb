					This is a game engine I am currently developing that is meant to simulate the rules and game logic of the classic miniature 
					board game Warhammer 40k. Since the game is fairly complex and has a lot of different rules to keep track of it is not the 
					easiest game to learn for a newcomer. Hence I figured it would be a nice idea to build an engine that uses the exact same rules, 
					takes into account all relevant factors and calculates an outcome for a given situation. The application is coded in C#. This 
					project is under development.
