==========

This is my portfolio website which can be found at martinsonesson.se

I will host all source-code in this public repository for anyone who is interested in seeing how it is built. Do note though that this website is under construction and will be changed continously.

The website itself is hosted on my own private server, which is a modified RaspberryPi.
