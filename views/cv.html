                        This was my first assignment via Annevo. I worked for about 2 years at <a href="https://www.wirelesscar.com/" target="_blank">WirelessCar</a> that delivers IT systems for car companies like Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz.
                        I worked in a project that developed a web platform used by vehicle fleet administrators. The vehicles were "smart vehicles" that could upload data into the cloud,
                        like GPS position, tire pressure, fuel level and so on. This data could then be fetched via microservices and be displayed in the web platform that I helped develop.
                        I mostly worked with frontend development, using technologies as Angular and Vue.

                        My second assignment via Annevo was at <a href="https://www.barium.se/" target="_blank">Barium</a>. Barium creates a platform, called Barium Live, that is used by their customers
                        to create customized forms and case management systems. The goal of the project was to migrate their older platform into a new one, using a more modern tech stack.
                        My time at Barium lasted only a few months, this is due to an unexpected sudden change in the project that made my role within the project obsolete.

                        My third assignment via Annevo is at a company called <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/" target="_blank">Recorded Future</a>. They deal with internet security
                        and threat intelligence. Their systems utilize machine learning technology to scour the web for possible threats and vulnerabilities and then score these on a scale
                        from low to critical. Many big corporations, including governments and authorities, are customers and pay for the data. My project at Recorded Future is to develop
                        and maintain a browser extension, that is available for Firefox and Chrome. The browser extension allows the user to get real time data while browsing around, by
                        constantly scraping the site for possible vulnerabilities and threats and then offering feedback to the user. It is an extension mainly used by professionals working
                        in the security/threat intelligence field. It has over 10 000 active users.

                    <p class="marginTop">
                        I have worked on this project during my entire stay at Recorded Future and since it is a smaller
                        project I am the only developer. Being solely in charge of the development of a product like this has really helped me grow, since the stability and functionality of the
                        product is my full responsibility. Therefore I have a bit of a tech lead role and I am fairly free to choose how I want to implement things. Since it is a browser extension
                        it is a fairly lightweight product that does not utilize any framework, like Angular or React, and does not really have any dependencies to outside libraries, which
                        is preferred when developing an extension/plugin. Because of this I have really had to hone my skills when it comes to native JavaScript and I feel that I have
                        improved a lot. The extension can be found <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recorded-future/cdblaggcibgbankgilackljdpdhhcine" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    I have worked about 4 years at Knowit as an IT-consultant. During this period I have been on an assignment as a web developer at Telia, one of the largest companies in Sweden in the
                    Telecom business. During my time at Telia I have been working in several different projects.

                    <p>
                        This was the first project I was a part of at Telia. I was assigned as a frontend web developer. The project was about migrating a DataNet business customer portal called WanOverView from an old platform to a new one. In this portal the customers can see and manage their different VPN's, subscriptions and orders of new DataNet subscriptions. The project was challenging becase we the team was spread out over several physical locations, tight timeline and budget as well as a lot of stakeholders.

                    <p class="marginTop">
                        My tasks consisted of developing presentation logic in Javascript using frameworks like require and jQuery. Also I was in charge of the design, working with the CMS, namely <a target="_blank" href="https://www.magnolia-cms.com/">Magnolia</a>, working close with UX resources, creating an AJAX frontend service layer against the backend Java services, server rendered logic in Freemarker and so on. The website can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="https://wanoverview.telia.se/">here</a>.

                    <p>
                        After working with WanOverView I was then later assigned to another project named "Mina sidor" (the portal is today called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.telia.se/privat/mitt-telia">Mitt Telia</a>). It is a portal where private customers login to manage and administrate their Telia services and engagements.

                        In this project my main focus was still mainly on frontend. I was introduced to some new technologies, like less and Angualar. There was also big a focus on responsiveness. The biggest challenge for me was that I entered the project in the later stages so I had a lot of catching up to do to get used to the vast codebase and complicated business requirements. We used an agile approach and used Jira an administrative tools for handling the stories and tasks.

                    <p>
                        In this ongoing project which I am currently assigned to I have been developing sales flows for private customers for broadband, ip telephony and tv services. This also includes flows for when ordering broadband services such as Spotify and Play+. During this project the frontend processes have been developing quite fast and because of this I have been introduced to a lot of new technologies, such as Grunt, npm, Jenkins, SiteCatalyst, Sonar, Confluence, Karma, Bower and so on. I also started working a lot more with the backend and became more of a full stack developer. The backend side consists of developing for Telias platform called Agora which is a service platform, a distributable packaging of Tomcat, Karaf, CXF and TeliaSonera micro-services. The challenge with the backend side programming is that the codebase is quite huge, there are a lot of different third party systems that we integrate towards and the business logic can also be quite complex.

                    At first my main working field was frontend and design. I was responsible for implementing new design changes to the software that were decided in discussions with the marketing team. I was also responsible for handling translation-issues with new or modified texts within the application. Further into my employment I worked less with pure frontend and more with a wider range of tasks, like backend logic, bugfixing, test/verification, handling support cases and so on. The software is a Windows application built in C# using the framework Windows Forms. Other Windows technologies like TFS and Visual Studio were also used.

                    During my time at Cochlear I feel that I have progressed a lot. I have become much more familiar and accustomed to programming and design patterns in general. I have also learned a lot more about working in a team on a given project with set deadlines for instance working using the Scrum agile process.
